# Pepper_Robot

## Key Features:
- **Greeting Users**: Pepper warmly welcomes users and starts a conversation in a friendly manner.
- **Gender-Based Customization**:
  - For male users: Pepper suggests kickboxing and CrossFit areas.
  - For female users: Pepper introduces beauty and health salon options.
- **Membership Selection**: Pepper presents different membership plans (e.g., one-month or one-year options).
- **Non-Verbal Communication**: Pepper uses gestures like handshakes, bowing, and showing catalogs to enhance the interaction.

## Implementation Tools:
- **Timeline Boxes**: Control movements like bowing and presenting catalogs.
- **Dialog Boxes**: Structured conversations to guide user interactions.
- **Switch Case Blocks**: Handle gender-specific and membership-related scenarios.

## Perceived Intelligence:
- Custom dialogues, mixed-initiative dialogues, gestures, and real-time adaptability contribute to Pepper’s perceived intelligence and sociability.

## Evaluation:
A Google Form-based questionnaire was used to assess Pepper’s performance across multiple dimensions, including intelligence, sociability, ease of use, likeability, and usefulness. The results were statistically analyzed using Cronbach's alpha, Shapiro-Wilk tests, and t-tests. Key findings include:
- **Reliability**: High reliability across all categories.
- **Normality**: Data followed a normal distribution.
- **Group Differences**:
  - **Prior Robot Experience**: Participants with prior robot experience rated the interaction higher.
  - **Gender and Trust**: Men reported higher trust in the robot compared to women.

## Statistical Analysis:
- **Reliability**: Cronbach's alpha values indicated high consistency in the responses.
- **Experience Effect**: Prior robot experience positively influenced trust and satisfaction.
- **Gender Effect**: Men had higher trust ratings compared to women.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the potential of social robots like Pepper in enhancing human-robot interactions by adapting to users and offering personalized experiences. The application of gender-based customization, non-verbal gestures, and friendly conversations made the interactions more engaging and realistic. Future improvements may focus on integrating voice recognition and more complex gestures to further enhance Pepper’s contextual understanding.
